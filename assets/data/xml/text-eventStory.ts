The game's objective is to get your pieces off the board first by moving them to the end of the board. Senet players are well advised to keep away from the House of Water, or else they have to restart at the House of Rebirth!:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_ROME:The game's name is ludus latrunculorum, or latrones for short - the game of brigands. The players agree on a number of pieces, such as 16 or 24, to place on an 8x8 board. They place their pieces on the board on alternate turns, finally placing the Dux - a leader piece. Once all the pieces are in place, the players move their pieces so as to catch opposing pieces between two of their own, thus capturing the enemy piece. Latrones has gained particular appreciation among young men and women looking to hone their skills as tacticians.:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_BABYLONIA:It's a two player game called the Game of Twenty Squares. The game is played on a board where two large rectangular areas are joined by a narrow \"bridge\". Both players have seven pieces, gradually placed on the board , and throw a four-sided die to determine the allowed moves. Players race to remove their own pieces by getting them to the other end of the board while trying to capture opposing pieces to impede their opponent's progress.:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_ASSYRIA:Nobody seems to know for sure whether the game is a local invention or was brought by traders from abroad. Whatever the case may be, it goes by \"game of fifty eight holes\", derived from the setup of the game board, which has two sets of twenty nine holes. One player has five sticks with dog heads while the other has five with jackal heads. The objective of the game is to gradually move your sticks past the opponent's to a point at the end of the board.:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_PERSIA:The game is known as nardashir, or nard for short. Each player has multiple ivory pieces, which are moved between triangles on the game board, with a throw of two dice determining the possible moves. Lone pieces may be captured by the opponent, while triangles with two or more pieces are invulnerable. Players race to the opposite end of the board while also attacking each other's pieces. In addition to being a tense game itself, nard has also attracted attention from gamblers.:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_CARTHAGE:Rumor has it, the game is a variant of another game played in far-off lands, though nobody knows for sure. Whatever the origin, the game is remarkably simple, needing nothing more than a series of holes and some seeds or stones to be played. Players place their seeds in pits, as if sowing. On each turn, the players rearrange their seeds across other pits, trying to capture some of the opponent's seeds in the process. The winner of this game can claim to be a more accomplished planner and landowner.:}{p.is_sub.S1=SUBJECT_PLAYER_GREECE:The people call this game petteia, and have come to consider it a test of wits and strategy. Two players face off on a rectangular board, one controls white pieces and the other one black. Players attempt to surround the opponent's pieces to capture them, and ultimately to leave their opponent with no moves to make.
